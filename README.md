### Synthetic data generator
  * Binary classification
  * Two d-dimensional Gaussian distribution
  * Homogeneous covariance: sigma = I
  * Fixed mean vector of first Gaussian: mu1 = (0, ..., 0)
  * mu2 = (mu, ..., mu)
  * Maximum achievable AUC estimated by Monte-Carlo simulation and optimal hyperplane
  * Optimal hyperplane: x_1 + ... + x_d = 0.5 * d * mu
